Hashing Functions
#################

Checksum
########
$ echo "I am learning hash functions" | cksum
   # Displays hash value
   # last value represents bytes

$ echo "I am learning hash functions" > message1.txt
$ cat message1.txt 
$ cksum message1.txt
   # Saves message to message1.txt
   # Displays the message from the file
   # Displays hash value
   # Its the same hash value than before

$ cksum message1.txt > message1.txt.cksum
   # Writes the output of the hash value into a text file

$ cksum message*
$ cksum <file1> <file2>
   # Wildcards can be used to check several files at once
   # You can also add each file individually
   # You can keep a log of files to see if they have changed

Md5sum
######
$ echo "Hello" | md5sum
   # Displays larger hash value than cksum
   # Has the same uses as cksum
   # Substitute command "md5sum" with "md5" in Mac.

$ md5sum message* > md5hashes.txt
$ md5sum -c md5hashes.txt
   # Creates a filename with the hashes for all files
   # Compares filenames and hashes
   # Quickly lets you know if a file was altered
   # You can keep a file with hashes in another computer and compare
   # -c Does not work for md5 in mac

Sha256
######
$ sha256sum <filename>
$ sha256sum -c <filename>
$ shasum -a 256 <filename> # for Mac
   # Most commonly used
   # when you download a file the SHA 256 hash is given
   # You can compare its value vs whats in the website
   # -c Does not work for md5 in mac
